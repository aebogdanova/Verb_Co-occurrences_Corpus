Partricipants: Anna Bogdanova, Alexander Ladontsev
Curator: Eduard Klyshinsky

This repository contains code for automatic extraction of Russian verb co-occurrences corpus. The corpus was collected from texts of more than 900 mln words, and extracting verb collocations was performed with the use of morphological and syntactic analyzer [deeppavlov](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/). For detailed information about the process of collecting the corpus see the [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12yM2xXrEDpR5XXzqZSLwKn7IjKHdYCcD/view?usp=sharing).
